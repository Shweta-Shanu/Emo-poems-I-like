 <p>I have done it again.<br> 
    One year in every ten<br>   
I manage it——</p>

<p>A sort of walking miracle, my skin<br>   
Bright as a Nazi lampshade,<br>   
My right foot</P>

<p>A paperweight,<br>
My face a featureless, fine<br>   
Jew linen.</p>

<p>Peel off the napkin<br>   
O my enemy.<br>   
                                                                                                            Do I terrify?——</p>

<p>The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?<br>   
The sour breath<br>
                                                                                                            Will vanish in a day.</p>

<p>Soon, soon the flesh<br>
The grave cave ate will be<br>   
                                                                                                            At home on me</p>

<p>And I a smiling woman.<br>   
I am only thirty.<br>
                                                                                                            And like the cat I have nine times to die.</P>

<p>This is Number Three.<br>   
What a trash<br>
                                                                                                            To annihilate each decade.</p>

<p>What a million filaments.<br>   
The peanut-crunching crowd<br>   
                                                                                                            Shoves in to see</P>

<p>Them unwrap me hand and foot——<br>
The big strip tease.<br>   
                                                                                                            Gentlemen, ladies</P>

<p>These are my hands<br>   
My knees.<br>
                                                                                                            I may be skin and bone,</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.<br>   
The first time it happened I was ten.<br>   
                                                                                                            It was an accident.</p>

<p>The second time I meant<br>
To last it out and not come back at all.<br>   
                                                                                                            I rocked shut</p>

                                                                                                            <p>As a seashell.<br>
They had to call and call<br>
                                                                                                            And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.</p>

<p>Dying<br>
Is an art, like everything else.<br>   
                                                                                                            I do it exceptionally well.</p>

<p>I do it so it feels like hell.<br>   
I do it so it feels real.<br>
                                                                                                            I guess you could say I’ve a call.</p>

<p>It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.<br>
It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.<br>   
                                                                                                            It’s the theatrical</p>

<p>Comeback in broad day<br>
To the same place, the same face, the same brute<br>   
                                                                                                            Amused shout:</p>

<p>‘A miracle!’<br>
That knocks me out.<br>   
                                                                                                            There is a charge</p>

<p>For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge<br>   
For the hearing of my heart——<br>
                                                                                                            It really goes.</p>

<p>And there is a charge, a very large charge<br>   
For a word or a touch<br>   
                                                                                                            Or a bit of blood</p>

<p>Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.<br>   
So, so, Herr Doktor.<br>   
                                                                                                            So, Herr Enemy.</p>

<p>I am your opus,<br>
I am your valuable,<br>   
                                                                                                            The pure gold baby</p>

<p>That melts to a shriek.<br>   
I turn and burn.<br>
                                                                                                            Do not think I underestimate your great concern.</pr>

<p>Ash, ash—<br>
You poke and stir.<br>
                                                                                                            Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——</p>

<p>A cake of soap,<br>   
A wedding ring,<br>   
                                                                                                            A gold filling.</p>

<p>Herr God, Herr Lucifer<br>   
Beware<Br>
                                                                                                            Beware.</P>

<P>Out of the ash<br>
I rise with my red hair<br>   
                                                                                                            And I eat men like air.</p>
