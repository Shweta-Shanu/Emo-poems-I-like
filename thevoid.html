 <p>
    The void inside us<br>
has jaws,<br>
those jaws have carnivorous teeth;<br>
those teeth will chew you up,<br>
those teeth will chew up everyone else.<br>
The dearth inside<br>
is our nature,<br>
habitually angry,<br>
in the dark hollow inside the jaws<br>
there is a pond of blood.<br>
This void is utterly black,<br>
is barbaric, is naked,<br>
disowned, debased,<br>
completely self absorbed.<br>
I scatter it,<br>
give it away,<br>
with fiery words and deeds.<br>
Those who cross my path<br>
find this void<br>
in the wounds<br>
I inflict on them.<br>
They let it grow,<br>
spread it around,<br>
scatter it and give it away<br>
to others,<br>
raising the children of emptiness.<br>
The void is very durable,<br>
it is fertile.<br>
Everywhere it breeds<br>
saws, daggers, sickles,<br>
breeds carnivorous teeth.<br>
That is why,<br>
wherever you look,<br>
there is dancing, jubilation,<br>
death is now giving birth<br>
to brand new children.<br>
Everywhere<br>
there are oversight<br>
with the teeth of saws,<br>
there are heavily armed mistakes:<br>
the world looks at them<br>
and walks on,<br>
rubbing its hands.<br>
