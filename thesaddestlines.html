    <p>I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.</p>

<p>Write, for instance: "The night is full of stars,<br>
    and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance."</p>

    <P>The night wind whirls in the sky and sings.</P>

<p>I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.<br>
    I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.</p>

<P>On nights like this, I held her in my arms.<br>
    I kissed her so many times under the infinite sky.</P>

<p>She loved me, sometimes I loved her.<br>
    How could I not have loved her large, still eyes?</p>

<p>I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.<br>
    To think I don't have her. To feel that I've lost her.</p>

<p>To hear the immense night, more immense without her.<br>
    And the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass.</p>

<p>What does it matter that my love couldn't keep her.<br>
    The night is full of stars and she is not with me.</p>

<p>That's all. Far away, someone sings. Far away.<br>
    My soul is lost without her.</p>

<p>As if to bring her near, my eyes search for her.<br>
    My heart searches for her and she is not with me.</p>

<p>The same night that whitens the same trees.<br>
    We, we who were, we are the same no longer.</p>

<p>I no longer love her, true, but how much I loved her.<br>
    My voice searched the wind to touch her ear.</p>

<p>Someone else's. She will be someone else's. As she once<br>
belonged to my kisses.<br>
    Her voice, her light body. Her infinite eyes.</p>

<p>I no longer love her, true, but perhaps I love her.<br>
    Love is so short and oblivion so long.</p>

<p>Because on nights like this I held her in my arms,<br>
    my soul is lost without her.</p>

<p>Although this may be the last pain she causes me,<br>
    and this may be the last poem I write for her.</p>
